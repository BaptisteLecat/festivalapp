#FestivApp the easiest way to go to a party#

This flutter app is a school project I have realised during my third year in EPSI. The goal of festivapp is to make a fully usable festival booking application. Users are able to view the events nearby and what artists go to it. In addition, they are able to take their ticket with the integrated payment method. Finally, administrators have the ability to edit, delete, and add events, artists, and categories.
